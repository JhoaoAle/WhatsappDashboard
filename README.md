# WhatsappDashboard
A personal analytics project based on a group chat.

The project will be divided in 2 notebooks:

**1. Cleaning and Updating:** This first notebook will contain the code used to adapt the new input added to the main dataset each week. This means: Cleaning, adding columns and ultimately merging with the main dataset once the data is clean.

**2. EDA:** This notebook will contain all the interactions performed within the main dataset during the stage of Exploratory Data Analysis.

The other part of the project will consist in a Power BI Dashboard where the nehaviour of the data will be explained, adapting each trend to the corresponding user; applying R scripting and offering a clean view of how the chat behaves in time
