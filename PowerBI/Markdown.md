# Whatsapp Dashboard for group chat

>This dashboard is based in the same dataset used in the Jupyter Notebooks: The exported whatsapp chats without including multimedia after being proccesed and cleaned. For this particular project I'm connecting to a MySQL database that contains all the information, which is updated by me weekly (Cleaning and Updating notebook in the root directory).

## What information does the dashboard contain?

The dashboard is separated in two different sorts of tabs: The "Main" tab and the "User" tab:

### Main tab

This tab contains global information regarding the group chat, and contains the following elements:

#### Group Members

This section contains various buttons with the alias of each group member, clicking on any of them allows us to check their User tab and review their group activity.


#### Messages Sent by User

This bar chart shows how many total messages have been sent by each User. Each one is sorted downwards and using the scroll is possible to see the rest.
